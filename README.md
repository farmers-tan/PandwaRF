[PandwaRF](http://pandwarf.com/) ([formerly GollumRF](http://gollumrf.com/news/no-more-gollumrf/)) is a RF analysis tool with a sub-1 GHz wireless transceiver controlled by a smartphone or a PC.
Its purpose is to capture, display & transmit RF data very easily.
It can be connected to an Android smartphone using BLE or USB, and to Linux using USB.
It is based on the well-known RfCat & Yard Stick One tools with the Texas Instruments CC1111 RF transceiver, but with a lot of new features, making PandwaRF the perfect portable RF analysis tool.

**Cheaper, simpler, smaller than a SDR.**
